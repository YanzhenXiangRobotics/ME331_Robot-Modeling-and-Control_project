# ME331-project

This is our final project of the course ME331: Modeling & Control of Robot at Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech). In this project, we mainly focus on trajectory tracking of the 3-DoF parallel delta robot. Basically, we use 5-order polynomial to conduct trajectory planning, and we apply four different control strategies to track the trajectory.
